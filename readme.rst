  - Manage all users (create, update, delete)
  - View all system activities
  - Assign lecturers to subjects

- **Lecturer Dashboard**
  - View assigned students
  - Manage subjects and grades
  - Send feedback to students

- **Student Dashboard**
  - View personal details and grades
  - View assigned subjects
  - Receive feedback from lecturers

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** CodeIgniter 3 (PHP Framework)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Custom role-based login
- **AJAX:** For seamless data operations
- **SweetAlert:** For user notifications and alerts

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management.git
   cd student-management
   ```

2. **Configure the Database**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., `student_db`)
   - Import the SQL dump file (if provided)

3. **Set Database Credentials**
   - Open `application/config/database.php`
   - Set your PostgreSQL connection details:
     ```php
     $db['default'] = array(
         'hostname' => 'localhost',
         'username' => 'your_db_user',
         'password' => 'your_db_pass',
         'database' => 'student_db',
         'dbdriver' => 'postgre',
         ...
     );
     ```

4. **Configure Base URL**
   - Open `application/config/config.php`
   - Set your base URL:
     ```php
     $config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/student-management/';
     ```

5. **Run the Application**
   - Open your browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost/student-management/
     ```

## Usage

- Log in using one of the predefined roles (Admin, Lecturer, or Student)
- Navigate to different dashboards to perform actions based on the user role

## Deployment Notes

- Make sure the Apache server is running
- PostgreSQL must be running and accessible
- Set appropriate file/folder permissions if deploying on a Linux server

## Security Group Configuration (if using cloud hosting like AWS)

Allow traffic on the following ports:
- **Port 22** – For SSH access
- **Port 80 or 443** – For HTTP/HTTPS web traffic
- **Port 3000** – If you're using Node.js for any backend tasks

#Backup Strategies
Full Backup

How it works: Copies all data every time a backup is made.

Advantages: Easy to restore.

Disadvantages: Takes the most time and storage.

Incremental Backup

How it works: Backs up only the data changed since the last backup.

Advantages: Saves time and space.

Disadvantages: Restoring takes more steps (requires last full + all incremental backups).

Differential Backup

How it works: Backs up changes since the last full backup.

Advantages: Faster restore than incremental.

Disadvantages: Larger than incremental but smaller than full.
